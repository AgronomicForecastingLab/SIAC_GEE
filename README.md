This is the GEE version of [SIAC](https://github.com/MarcYin/SIAC), under the intention of utilizing the power of GEE servers and wide variety of data. It has a simple UI based on the GEE UI APIs, which has the ability to search available Sentinel 2 images based on point clicked on the map, defined date range and cloud coverage, and correct for selected one image tile or do AC for all of them.
